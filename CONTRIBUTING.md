# Contributing to StoryEngine

Welcome! :boom::book: Thanks for your interest in contributing to StoryEngine — we're excited you're here! :book::boom:


StoryEngine is a method of research and evaluation designed for listening and learning from the ones in your life who matter most. Our process uses interviews to draft stories, which are then edited in collaboration with each participant. The finished story can be used for anything including and not limited to marketing, communications, and advocacy — while simultaneously forming a dataset that can foster learning, and uncover new insights.

The following is a list of guidelines for contributing to StoryEngine, which is hosted by [LoupDesign](https://github.com/LoupDesign). These are mostly guidelines, and not rules; use your best judgment and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## Code of Conduct
This project and everyone participating in it are governed by the [StoryEngine Code of Conduct](https://github.com/LoupDesign/StoryEngine/blob/master/CODE%20OF%20CONDUCT.md). This is the code you are expected to uphold if you choose to participate in this project. Please report any unacceptable behavior to github@loup.design.

## How can I Contribute?

### Tackle an issue / further the project
Help us tackle issues. These [labels](#Issue-and-Pull-Request-Labels) will help you find an issue that matches your talents or expertise. Then use a pull request to help resolve the issue.

### File an issue
Notice a problem but don't know how to fix it? File an issue. Filing an issue is essentially ways to report errors or bugs. In the case of StoryEngine, we also use issues to call attention to specific tasks and areas we need help tackling. Please use these [labels](#Issue-and-Pull-Request-Labels) (as applicable) to file an issue.

### File a pull request
When you help us tackle issues, you will most likely submit it in the form of a **pull request**. File a pull request for specific recommendations on how to improve our content or fix copy errors. When you open a pull request, you’re requesting that we review the changes you have made. If the changes fit what we are looking for, we will pull your contribution into the project and merge them with our branch. Once a pull request is opened, you can discuss and review the potential changes with collaborators and add follow-up commits before the changes are merged into the repository. Please use these [labels](#Issue-and-Pull-Request-Labels) (as applicable) to file a pull request.

### Suggest an area of enhancement to the project
Don't see yourself on this list? Do you see an area of expertise, or a new way in which we can enhance the StoryEngine project? To suggest new features and minor improvements to the existing project, file an issue and label it `enhancement`.

### Join our Slack workspace
Want to join the StoryEngine conversation? Have a question? Join our [StoryEngine Slack Workspace](https://join.slack.com/t/storyengine/shared_invite/enQtMzYwOTk5NDMxMTM3LTUwM2U1MDUxNGRjNWYwNWU4NGNmMWRjMzM3ZjVlMmVkN2U4ODkzN2VlOTMyZWEzZjhhMzlmYzUwNTk4YjJkNzY) to communicate with us about all things StoryEngine.

## Your first Contribution
`beginner`issues are easy ways to contribute; these issues can be done with minimal effort or knowledge of the project.

Suggesting edits or improvements to the following is another good place to start (label them `suggestions`):
- [README](https://github.com/LoupDesign/StoryEngine/blob/master/README.md) 
- [StoryEngine Guide](https://storyengine.io/guide) 
* Note that we appreciate specific suggestions and recommendations on how to improve our content. Feel free to make a suggestion if anything feels missing or incomplete. We are also looking for any copy errors. (Does it make sense? Do you understand it? Can you find all the information that you need? Are there any typos?)

## Issue and Pull Request Labels
This section lists the labels we use to help us track and manage issues and pull requests. If applicable, please use the following labels when filing an issue or pull request — this will help others find ways to contribute that match with their talents.
